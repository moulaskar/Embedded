- Please Note that implementation here is not tree based but have used the IPVector generated from 
genertic algorithm provided in the paper.
- This code is implementation of Figure 3 of paper.
- Gist of Implementation:
  - Each blacks in a set is associated with a index, from 0 to (num_way-1)
  - A vector is created which is shared between all the blocks within the set
  - Job of this vector is to store the information about the status of each 
    block within the set. The status changes based on const IPV vector.
  - Each set will have its own such vectors. 
  - This vector's index is mapped to block's index. For example
  - if block's index is 0, it represents the index 0 of the vect.
  - All manupulation is done on the vect which actually represents the blocks within the sets
